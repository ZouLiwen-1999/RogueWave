# RogueWave
This is the released dataset referred from the paper 'Measuring the rogue wave pattern triggered from Gaussian perturbations by deep learning'. All the images are named as aXeYuZ where X, Y and Z are the value of a, epsilon and mu of the initial equation. A image corresponds to a .xml file which contains the boudding boxes annotation of the origin images for the rogue wave detection.
