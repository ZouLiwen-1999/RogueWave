# RogueWave
This is the released RWD-10K dataset which has 10191 rogue wave images referred from the paper 'Measuring the rogue wave pattern triggered from Gaussian perturbations by deep learning'(https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08909). All the images are named as aXeYuZ where X, Y and Z are the value of a, epsilon and mu of the initial equation. One .jpg image file corresponds to one .xml file which contains the bounding boxes annotation of the origin images for the rogue wave detection.
